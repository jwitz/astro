# Astro Enhancement Proposals

The purpose of an Astro Enhancement Proposal (AEP) is to introduce any major change to the Astro library.
This is required in order to balance the need to support new features, use cases, while avoiding
accidentally introducing half thought-out interfaces that cause needless problems when changed.

This documentation is heavily based on the [Airflow Improvement Proposals](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals).


## What is considered a major change that needs an API?

Any of the following should be considered a major change:
* Any change that impacts the public interfaces of the project

All the following are considered public interfaces of Astro:
* Operators


## Lifecycle

*tl;dr;*

Examples of life cycles:
Draft -> Proposed -> Accepted -> Completed
Draft -> Proposed -> Abandoned

### Draft

Most proposals start with an idea. If you have an idea of how Astro could improve,
create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/astro-projects/astro/issues/new) and,
label it with `enhancement`.

We encourage you to start a Draft document in the [aep](.) folder an make a pull request,
so others can discuss it. Please, follow the [AEP template](./AEP-template.md).

### Proposed

Once you or someone else feels like there’s a rough consensus on the idea and 
there’s no strong opposition, you can move your proposal to the Vote phase.

This is done by encouraging people to add the reactions "+1" or "-1" in the Github issue.

### Accepted

Congratulations! Your proposal has been accepted. 

Next up is breaking down tasks using
the [Github Issues page](https://github.com/astro-projects/astro/issues/new).

Ask a commiter to create a label for your AEP, and link all your issues with it for easier
maintainability.

We encourage you to involve the Astro community in reviewing the proposed tasks before they are
implemented. **HOW?**

Once the issues are reviewed, we encourage you following the **Contributing guidelines**.

### Completed

Please, move your AIP to complete after you consider the main bulk of wokr has been merged to
the `main` branch of the respoisotry. It is okay to leave open issues for minor follow up tasks
like adding additional capabilities or similar.

### Abandoned

AEP may be moved to abandoned if therhas been no owner or intention of developing it further for
over a year or if the owner decides to abandon it. The later can happen if the creator decides to
refactor the AEP into a new AEP for example or if there is a proposal that supersedes the original AEP.
